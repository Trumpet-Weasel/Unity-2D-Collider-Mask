# Unity-2D-Collider-Mask
A script that allows for the masking of a PolygonCollider2D in the Unity game engine.

This is a small script I threw together that uses <a href="https://github.com/AngusJohnson/Clipper2">Angus Johnsons Clipper2 Library</a> to mask a PolygonCollider2D.

The script takes three to masking collider:

The script takes three different colliders:
Subject Collider - The base collider that represents the full collider.
Clipping Collider - The collider that acts as a mask for the subject collider.
Output Collider - The output of the mask.
